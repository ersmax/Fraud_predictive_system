# PREDICTIVE SYSTEM FOR FRAUDS DETECTION

The aim is to build a predictive framework to frauds. Frauds are a serious matter. It may be better to spend the time of consultant to analyse 500 transactions, than turning a blind eye on a single fraud due to the financial cost of it. This ML project aims to predict frauds in a kaggle dataset with more than 1,000,000 transactions and compare the performance of different unsupervised and supervised algorithms.

The performance of different models will be compared by means of ROC curves, Recall, F1, target 1:500 and cost of misclassification.
